# How to nail any CS interviews? A three-month plan

# Who am I?
I discovered a late interest in computer science four years ago, but it has occupied most of my days since then. I am passionate about new technologies.
I have a degree in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science. After my university studies, I decided that I would go to work for a big American software company. It will be Google, Amazon, Microsoft or nothing!
Within these companies, the richness and diversity of talent would allow me to progress at high speed in my engineering career. Working with bright people is the best way to improve. These companies arrange themselves to accommodate your life in the best way possible so that you can be happy and effective at work. I love that mentality!

It is by preparing me thoroughly for several months, and with the conviction that I will succeed, that I passed the interviews for Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Bloomberg, Palantir, and some other startup. The job position was very varied: computer science, machine learning, finance and software engineering. 

I tend to think everything can be engineered, so I prepare for interviews as someone else would prepare for a marathon. It's a long way to go, but the success is even better.

In this manual, I share my detailed preparation. Have fun!

# Preparation

## 1. Update your CV and your online presence (Linkedin, Github, Blog). 
I recommend that you have your writing proofread and corrected by a professional. __Fiverr__ is a good website to get help from such people if you don't know anyone in your surroundings. Even if it costs ten dollars, don't be greedy for the job of your dream.

In talking to various recruiters, I learned that they spend about 10 seconds on your Github page looking at the number of followers and the number of starry repository :sweat_smile:. Having a blog seems to be a significant bonus
* __Time Estimate__: 2 weeks

## 2. Apply for your dream jobs
Pages where you apply automatically (with/without a cover letter), and where your candidacy is analyzed by robots are a waste of time. Give preference to the human!
1. If you have contacts in the company you are interested in, try to get referrals. It is the quickest way to get the interview process rolling out.
2. Otherwise, contact engineers or recruiters directly on Linkedin. In 75% of the cases, the person will answer you and be ready to help you.
3. Another great way is to work with recruitment companies that will have job offers and will help you throughout the interviews. Be careful though, these recruiters get a bonus if you find a job through them! From the moment you receive an offer, they won't let you down until you accept it. Be prepared to say No if you have better.

Apply more than enough. Try to do as many interviews as possible. 
Even if you are not interested in certain companies, do their interviews to prepare yourself! Also, the more offers you get, the more you can negotiate. You will be also able to put pressure on the company you are interested in so that they can speed up the interview process if they want to get you an offer on time. 

* __Time Estimate__: 3 weeks

## 3. Improve your algorithm skills

It is impossible to judge the quality of an engineer within hours. Interviews are an approximate measure of your potential to meet job requirements. They'll test your knowledge in computer science, and specifically your algorithm skills. Having done a lot of competitive programming in my free time, I found the interview questions pretty simple. There is no trick in the problems, you'll be mostly asked questions that involved handling data in a data structure, a problem solvable with a binary search, or a graph problem. You'll never be asked to implement a binary search tree, but knowing how to use one in your favorite language is a requirement. 

You should spend __1 month__ on this part. I recommend solving __all__ the problems in `Cracking the Code` by Gayle McDowell. When you are confident with your algorithm skills, go and solve more than twenty problems on `pramp.com`. 
As a competitive programming student, I was asked to solve problems quickly. As a future interviewee, you'll be asked to communicate your solution clearly and talk while thinking.

I'll never emphasize enough how `pramp.com` has helped me becomes a problem solver master. If you learn to solve them on your own, you will fail miserably the interviews. Practise to talk, talk, and talk again. Communication should become a help as you'll realize your solution has a draw, or your implementation has a bug. 

Finally, practice for a few days on a whiteboard. If you don't have one, just use a paper. Another way to practice is to code without ever deleting. The secret is to be aware of what you'll write next Don't start coding if you don't know how to end your algorithm. Talking out loud is of great help. Practice makes perfect, you'll get to this point with time.

* __Time Estimate__: 1 month

## 4. Fill the behavioral questions form

Not all the companies will ask behavioral questions. Try to find out if your future interviews contain these questions. For example, for Google interviews, you won't get any. This is not the case with Amazon and Palantir.

* __Time Estimate__: 1 week

## 5. Prepare for the system design interview

As a fresh graduate, this might be the hardest interview if you have a background in computer science, and not in software engineering. If you feel uncomfortable with [this exercise](https://github.com/checkcheckzz/system-design-interview), read this [book](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920032175.do) to develop a knowledge of the technologies underlying all the major current computer systems (Google Search, Amazon Shop, Messenger). I've written a summary available in the attached files.

In the meantime, do this [MOOC](https://www.educative.io/collection/5668639101419520/5649050225344512). 
In the attached files, you'll find ten examples showing you how to structure your reply answer. To succeed, you should always the same plan provided.

* __Time estimate__: 3 weeks

## 6. Start the interviews
Get the process rolling out for multiple companies. If you get interviews for a `GAFA alike` company, it will be easy to get more. The biggest secret is that big company are looking for external validation of your candidacy. If you show them that other companies are interested in you, you'll be in a good position to get whatever company you want.

One day before the interview, go on Glassdoor, in the interview section, you'll be surprised how often questions get reused!  
Before the interviews, don't stress yourself. Play sports, or an activity that will keep your brain busy from worry.

## 7. Negotiate your offers
The more offer you have, the better position you are to negotiate. You should not negotiate if you have a single offer, but if you follow the steps in the manual, you should arrive here with multiple offers.
Remember that if you don't negotiate, you left some money on the table.  

## Total: 3 month preparation

I hope you enjoy the work. Sharing my work freely and open sourcing is a real pride for me. If you think my work deserves a :star:, or a thank-you, here is my Bitcoin address __17vktBCzLhZVKfKTZZiWsxCy6kWTdMBAnZ__ :pray:.

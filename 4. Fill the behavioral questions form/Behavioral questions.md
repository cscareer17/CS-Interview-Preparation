# Introduction
This is an extensive ordered list of behavioral questions that I found relevant to be prepared. People often tend to believe they can provide a clear and correct answer to a behavioral question without preparing. This is a clear misunderstanding of the hidden complexity of this exercise. You will face a highly prepared HR that knows what he is looking for, and is expecting you to be clear and concise. Just take some time preparing the following questions. It is very easy to shine if you are prepared, but also regret it if you make a stalemate!
You must carry out an introspection work on your professional path, your qualities, and your deficiencies. 
I suggest doing this exercise passively, searching for the best answer when it comes to your mind. Sometimes, you will block on an answer, just postpone it to later, and move to another one.

# Know yourself

### Present yourself
**TO FILL**
Go in chronological order
* Now, I am (role)
* I have a (degree)
* I did (relevant extra-scholar activity)
* I went to (current company), because (reason)
* What I do at (current company) is (activity)
#### Bonus
* Outside of work, I am interested in (smtg). **Show that you are an interesting person**
* I want to be part of a company because (reason). **Show that you are coherent with your project**

### What is your strengths
* **TO FILL**
* Prepare at least four strengths. HR knows people prepare this question for the first two strengths. If they ask for more, and you can give coherent and relevant strengths, you will definitely win some points
* Example: trustworthy, committed, always pushing your limit, curious, patient...

### Are you looking for validation of others?
* **TO FILL**
* Show, you can work on your own without waiting for approval from your mentors

### What is your ideal working environment?
* **TO FILL**

### Describe five weakness
* **TO FILL**
* Same as strengths. Finding more than enough will be beneficial if HR tries to trick you. Ask someone qualified to get the best answers to this question. This is a very important question, and you will be able to find answers to other questions if you have identified good weaknesses.
* Here is an example: 
* I have a very broad knowledge of computer science, and it is very easy for me to understand people in computer science. I can think and share some technical knowledge in a foreign language, such as English, but I'm sometimes struggling to share feelings and complex opinions. I try to improve my English, by reading some book, writing some blogs, listening to politics.

### What motivates you?  
* **TO FILL**

### Present two of your Proudest achievement
* **TO FILL**
* Try to pick one achievement: a professional achievement, and an achievement that you are personally satisfied with (ex: I'm very proud about my career decision, when I decide to study computer science, instead of architecture. I've been meeting amazing people during the journey. I've been successful at what I did).

### What is the most challenging project?
* **TO FILL**
* In this example, you will show what is a challenge for you. Don't answer something too simple, or too banal. For example, a challenging problem is when there is no known solution, and we can't afford to solve the problem.

### Tell me about your favorite technical problem you overcame?
* **TO FILL**

### What is the hardest thing you have ever done?
* **TO FILL**
 
### Tell me about a time when you used logic to solve a problem
* **TO FILL**
* This one is tricky to find. If you have a technical example in mind, try to formulate it in generic terms that everyone can understand. Be precise, without becoming complicated. And, as usual, suggest that you give your interviewer a more detailed answer.


### Plans for learning new programming language
* **TO FILL**
* This shows a willingness to learn, as well as consistency in its progression. 

# Career development
### Important lesson you learned moving from a student to a professional developer
